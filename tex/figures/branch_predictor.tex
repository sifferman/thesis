        Block diagram of the Global Two-Level Branch Predictor Design featured in \enquote{Labs with CVA6}. Participants are tasked with transforming CVA6's branch predictor into a more-sophisticated global predictor, enhancing the processor's performance by improving branch hit-rate for specifically designed benchmarks \cite{labsWithCVA6}.
